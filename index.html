      <h2>What Do We Mean by “Digital Payments” on Cards?</h2>
      <p>Digital payments cover everything from stored cards in an app to invisible card-on-file charges running in the background of a subscription. In most cases, the merchant or platform holds a tokenized representation of your card and initiates charges without you physically presenting plastic.</p>
      <p>The user experience may look radically different—QR codes, super apps, embedded checkout—but the underlying authorization, clearing and settlement flows often follow the same patterns that power traditional card transactions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How a DigiPay Transaction Flows End to End</h2>
      <p>When you confirm a purchase in an app or on a website, the merchant’s payment gateway formats a request using a stored card token or encrypted card data. That request is sent to an acquirer, routed over the card network and evaluated by your issuer in real time.</p>
      <p>Along the way, extra data points—device fingerprints, IP addresses, session history, 3-D Secure results—are attached to the authorization. Issuer risk systems use this context to decide whether to approve, challenge or decline the transaction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Tokenization, Card-on-File and Network Vaults</h2>
      <p>Instead of storing the raw card number, many platforms rely on tokenization. A token replaces the card number, and only the card network or issuer can map the token back to the real credentials. The merchant holds the token and uses it for future charges.</p>
      <p>Some issuers and networks run their own “network token vaults”, which keep tokens alive even when a card is reissued. That lets subscriptions and recurring payments continue without you manually updating card details on every service.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>APIs, PSPs and Embedded Payment Providers</h2>
      <p>Modern digital payments are orchestrated through APIs. Payment service providers (PSPs) expose endpoints for capturing, confirming and refunding card transactions, while abstracting away scheme rules and regional differences.</p>
      <p>For cardholders, this means the same card can behave differently depending on which PSP or platform is initiating the charge. Strong customer authentication prompts, currency handling and fee structures can vary between providers even when the card itself is identical.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Security, SCA and Fraud Controls in Digital Journeys</h2>
      <p>Because the card is not physically present, digital payments rely heavily on layered security: device recognition, behavioral analytics, 3-D Secure flows and real-time velocity checks. These tools help issuers distinguish a normal login from a takeover attempt.</p>
      <p>Cardholders can further reduce risk by enabling alerts in their banking app, reviewing merchants with card-on-file access and periodically revoking tokens for services that are no longer used.</p>
