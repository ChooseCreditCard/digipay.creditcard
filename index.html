        <p class="hero-lead">
          When you click “Pay now”, a digital payment gateway connects the online store to
          card networks and banks. This page explains, in plain language, what a gateway does
          with your card details, how fees are applied, and how risk checks are run in the
          background.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Digital Payment Gateway?</h2>
      <p>
        A digital payment gateway is the technical middle layer between a merchant
        (online shop, app, subscription service) and the card networks and banks that
        move money. It collects payment details securely, builds an authorization request,
        sends it to the processor or acquiring bank, and returns an approve/decline outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gateways are not the same as card issuers or wallets. They do not decide your
        credit limit or interest rate. Instead, they focus on connectivity, security and
        routing – making sure a payment request is formatted correctly, encrypted and sent
        to the right place.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Flow -->
    <section id="flow" class="section">
      <h2>From Checkout Click to Authorization</h2>
      <p>
        A typical digital gateway flow looks like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Checkout</strong> – You enter card details or select a stored card/wallet.</li>
        <li><strong>Tokenization</strong> – The gateway replaces raw card numbers with a token for storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorization request</strong> – Data is packaged and routed to the processor/acquirer.</li>
        <li><strong>Network &amp; issuer checks</strong> – Card network and your bank run balance, risk and limit checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Response</strong> – Approved or declined, with a reason code.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture &amp; settlement</strong> – Later, the merchant captures funds and they settle to its account.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Gateways may add their own fraud checks before submitting to the network – for example,
        blocking obvious misuse or asking for additional authentication when a risk score is high.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees & Risk -->
    <section id="fees" class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Pricing Models and Risk Management</h2>
      <p>
        Payment gateways usually charge merchants using one or more of these models:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Per-transaction fee</strong> – a fixed amount plus a percentage of the transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly platform fee</strong> – for access to the gateway and tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Blended rate</strong> – one simple %, regardless of card type or network cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Interchange++</strong> – pass-through of underlying network costs plus a gateway markup.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Gateways and processors also share risk around chargebacks and fraud. Some offer
        risk-management tools such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>velocity checks (too many transactions in a short period)</li>
        <li>device fingerprinting and geolocation checks</li>
        <li>3-D Secure or similar step-up authentication flows</li>
        <li>blacklists/whitelists based on prior behaviour</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tools help merchants reduce fraud but can also cause friction if tuned too
        aggressively, resulting in more declined legitimate payments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Integration -->
    <section id="integration" class="section">
      <h2>How Gateways Integrate With Apps and Websites</h2>
      <p>
        From a business or developer perspective, digital gateways expose APIs, SDKs and
        hosted checkout pages so you do not need to build card-processing logic from scratch.
        Typical integration patterns include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hosted payment page</strong> – redirect to the gateway’s secure page.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded card fields</strong> – gateway-hosted input fields inside your checkout.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct API integration</strong> – full control for large merchants and platforms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Gateways often bundle extra features around subscriptions, invoicing, payouts and
        alternative payment methods (wallets, bank transfers, local payment schemes) so
        merchants can manage everything from a single dashboard.
